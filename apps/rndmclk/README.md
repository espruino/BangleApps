# Summary

Random Clock is a widget that will randomly show one of the installed watch faces each time the LCD is turned on.

## Disclaimer
This is an early version and will load a clock each time the LCD is turned on no matter what app was running before the screen went to standby. Also the next watch face is only loaded after the last one is shown for a few tens of seconds.
