# Summary
Random Clock is a widget that will randomly show one of the installed watch faces each time after the widget is (re-)loaded.

# How it works
Everytime the widget is reloaded, it randomly changes the clock. When you long press BTN 3 the next time,
you might (or might not, it's random after all) see another watch face.
