# Power Saver

Save your watch's battery power by halting foreground app execution while the screen is off.

## Features
- Stops foreground app processes
- Background processes still run
- Clears screen
- Foreground app is returned to when screen is turned back on (app state is not preserved)

## Controls
- Automatically activates when screen times out, timing can be adjusted using normal timeout settings
- Deactivates when screen is turned back on

## Warnings
- This is not compatible with apps that need to run in the foreground even while the screen is off, such as most stopwatch apps and some health trackers.
- If you check your watch super often (like multiple times per minute), this may end of costing you more power than it saves since the app you are using will have to restart everytime you check it.
