0.02: Handle new firmwares with 'lock' event
0.03: Don't try to be fancy - just bail out on firmwares without a lock event
0.04: Set sortorder to -1 so that widget always takes up the furthest left position
0.05: Set sortorder to -10 so that others can take -1 etc
0.06: Set sortorder to -10 in widget code
0.07: Remove check for .isLocked (extremely old firmwares), speed up widget loading
0.08: Don't completely remove the lock widget when screen unlocked (use 1px) to ensure appRect/drawWidgets still thinks there are widgets
