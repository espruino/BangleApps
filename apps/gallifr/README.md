# Time Traveller's Clock

The time travelling wristwatch is for those who are so attuned to the ebb and flow of time that they no longer require antiquated numbers to read the time.

For those that need some tuition in the ways of the time traveller, the light coloured segment of the pie chart provides a traditional readout of minute.  The black sphere that revolves around the edge of the display provides an indication of the hour.

## Features

The following aspects are customisable using the App Loader Menu system:

1. Colour; the dial has four colour schemes:
- shades of green
- shades of red
- shades of blue
- a 1980's scheme
2. Widgets; these can be turned on or off - when turned off, the dial uses the whole screen and is slightly larger
3. Decoration; for those attuned to the time streams, the dial itself reads 'time'.  For those who don't need to be reminded what the dial is for, this can be optionally turned off.

## Code description
The code includes some functions that others may find useful in creating their own applications.  These are explained in my robot-building blog [here](https://k9-build.blogspot.com/).
