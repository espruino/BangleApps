# My Location

*Sets and stores GPS lat and lon of your preferred city*

To access, you have two options:

**In the App Loader** once My Location is installed, click on the 'Save' icon
next to it - and you can choose your location on a map.

**On Bangle.js** go to `Settings -> Apps -> My Location`

* Select one of the preset Cities, setup through the GPS or use the webinterface from the AppLoader
* Other Apps can read this information to do calculations based on location
* When the City shows ??? it means the location has been set through the GPS

## Example Code

    const LOCATION_FILE = "mylocation.json";
    let location;

    // requires the myLocation app
    function loadLocation() {
      location = require("Storage").readJSON(LOCATION_FILE,1)||{"lat":51.5072,"lon":0.1276,"location":"London"};
    }

## Screenshots
