# My Location

- Other Apps can read this information to do calculations based on location
- When the City shows ??? it means the location has been set through the GPS

## Example Code

    const LOCATION_FILE = "mylocation.json";
    let location;

    // requires the myLocation app
    function loadLocation() {
      location = require("Storage").readJSON(LOCATION_FILE,1)||{"lat":51.5072,"lon":0.1276,"location":"London"};
    }
