# Resistor Calculator

Resistor Calculator is a Bangle.js application designed to assist with resistor color code interpretation and vice versa. It provides a convenient way to calculate the resistance value based on color bands and to find the color bands based on the resistance value.

## Usage

There are two main functions of the Resistor Calculator:

1. **Calculate resistance from color bands:** You can select the colors of the 4 bands on the resistor, and the app will calculate the resistance and tolerance accordingly.

2. **Find color bands from resistance:** You can specify a resistance value, multiplier, and tolerance percentage, and the app will display the corresponding color bands.

The Resistor Calculator presents these functions in an intuitive menu system. Navigate through the menus using the touchscreen on your Bangle.js 2 watch.

## Configuration

The Resistor Calculator does not require any specific configurations. All settings are managed within the app itself. After installing the app, you can start it from your Bangle.js watch's app launcher.

## Compatibility

The Resistor Calculator is only compatible with Bangle.js 2 watches.
