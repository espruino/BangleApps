28x6: Twenty-Eight by Six
========

28x6 is a 28 hour day, 6 day a week clock that syncs up with the ancient 24 hour a day, 7 day a week clock every Monday at 12:01 (midnight) / 28:01 (THE VOID).

The clock includes normal time on the top half of the screen and 28x6 time on the bottom half. Throughout the day are helpful labels of when to eat meals, work, and sleep.

You can swipe right and left to skip ahead and behind an hour at a time for ease of converting your scheduling to normal time.

The new hour names are as follows:
* 13:00am/13:00 Middle-day Nothingness
* 14:00am/14:00 Forescoreteen, also known as the Lincoln hour. Many take a Lincoln Lunch at this time.
* 13:00pm/27:00 Threeteen
* 14:00pm/28:00 THE VOID
