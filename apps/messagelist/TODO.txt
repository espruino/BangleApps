## Nice to have:
* Add labels to B1 music HW buttons
* Add volume buttons to B2 music screen (when controls are enabled)
* Draw messages ourselves instead of piling hacks on Layout
* Make sure all icons are 24x24px: icon sizes affect layout
* Check/optimize layout for B1, other fonts (scrolling for just 5px is a shame)

## Wishlist:
* Option to swipe-dismiss (instead of action menu)
* Maybe refactor showGrid() out into a general-use module?

* Message replies (needs `android` support)
* Customize replies
* Custom replies (i.e. `textinput`)
* Hooks to add custom replies/actions, 
  e.g. external code could add "Send intent" option to Home Assistant messages
  Maybe just use this for all replies, so we don't hardcode anything in "messages"?
