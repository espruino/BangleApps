# Imperial Metric Converter

A simple app for converting measurements from metric to imperial and imperial to metric.

## Controls

Scroll through the menus and select the measurement you want to convert, choose it, and then type in the number you want to convert.

Click the button (on the side of the watch) to confirm and then click it again if you want to go back to the main menu

## Other stuff
Credit to the contacts app for the keypad, I took some (very) heavy inspiration from that

Also if anyone notices that one of the equations are wrong (at least one probably is) then either just change it or let me know, its very easy to change the equations when editing the code.
