Hacky app that uses Messages app and it's library to push a message that triggers the music controls. It's nearly not an app, and yet it moves.

Making the music controls accessible this way lets one start a music stream on the phone in some situations even though the message app didn't receive a music message from gadgetbridge to begin with. (I think.)

It is suggested to use Messages Music along side the app Quick Launch.

Messages app is created by Gordon Williams with contributions from [Jeroen Peters](https://github.com/jeroenpeters1986).

The icon used for this app is from [https://icons8.com](https://icons8.com).
