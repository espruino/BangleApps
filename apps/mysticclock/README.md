# Mystic Clock for Bangle.js

A retro-inspired watchface featuring time, date, and an interactive data display line.

## Features

- 24 or 12-hour time (adjustable via the Settings menu)
- Variable colors (also in the Settings)
- Interactive data display line (use upper and lower watch-buttons to rotate between values)
- Cover watch screen with your hand to put it to sleep (the watch, not your hand)
- International localization of date (which can be disabled via the Settings if memory becomes an issue)

The interactive line rotates between the following items:

- Current time zone
