## Future features

I'm keen to complete this project with

* Ability to dismiss the app and leave it running in the background
* A small widget to show the elapsed time on the current active clock
* Laptimes, with a way to view all the laptimes on a scrollable screen


## One of these is a genuine Bangle Js 2 Open Source Smartwatch, the other isn't

Which one is which ?
