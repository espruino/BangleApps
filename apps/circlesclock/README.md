  * Heart rate (automatically updates when screen is on and unlocked)
  * Battery (including charging status and battery low warning)
  * Weather (requires [OWM weather provider](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=owmweather))
       * Humidity or wind speed as circle progress
       * Temperature inside circle
       * Condition as icon below circle
       * Big weather icon next to clock
  * Time and progress until next sunrise or sunset (requires [my location app](https://banglejs.com/apps/#mylocation))
  * Temperature, air pressure or altitude from internal pressure sensor


The color of each circle can be configured. The following colors are available:
  * Basic colors (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, black, white)
