0.11: Fix to handle updated firmware on fw 2v25 (or cutting edge >2v24.164), btn -> btnRelease. The timer would fire on long press before the watch reset.
0.12: Fix ClockInfo so it updates after leaving +5min/etc by blurring
      ClockInfo now shows time left in icon, updates more often the closer to the time
      Tapping clockinfo adds 1 min, added +30min option too
