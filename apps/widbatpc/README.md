# Battery Widget

Show the current battery level and charging status in the top right of the clock, with charge percentage
        
Works with Bangle 1 and Bangle 2

When the fillbar setting is on the level colour will fill the entire
bar.  This makes for an easier to read display when the charge is
below 50%.

When the fillbar setting is off the level colour will follow the battery percentage
