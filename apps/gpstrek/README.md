# GPS Trekking

Helper for tracking the status/progress during hiking. Do NOT depend on this for navigation!

This app is inspired by and uses code from "GPS Navigation" and "Navigation compass".

## Usage

Tapping or button to switch to the next information display, swipe right for the menu.

Choose either a route or a waypoint as basis for the display.

After this selection and availability of a GPS fix the compass will show a checkered flag for your destination and a green dot for possibly available waypoints on the way.
Waypoints are shown with name if available and distance to waypoint.

As long as no GPS signal is available the compass shows the heading from the build in magnetometer. When a GPS fix becomes available, the compass display shows the GPS course. This can be differentiated by the display of bubble levels on top and sides of the compass.
If they are on display, the source is the magnetometer and you should keep the bangle level. There is currently no tilt compensation for the compass display.

### Route

Routes can be created from .gpx files containing "trkpt" elements with this script: [createRoute.sh](createRoute.sh)

The resulting file needs to be uploaded to the watch and will be shown in the file selection menu.

The route can be mirrored to switch start and destination.

If the GPS position is closer than 30m to the next waypoint, the route is automatically advanced to the next waypoint.

### Waypoints

You can select a waypoint from the "Waypoints" app as destination.

## Calibration

### Altitude

You can correct the barometric altitude display either by manually setting a known correct value or using the GPS fix elevation as reference. This will only affect the display of altitude values.

### Compass

If the compass fallback starts to show unreliable values, you can reset the calibration in the menu. It starts to show values again after turning 360Â°.

## Widget

The widget keeps the sensors alive and records some very basic statistics when the app is not started. It shows as the app icon in the widget bar when the background task is active.
This uses a lot of power so ensure to stop the app if you are not actively using it.
