# DayMoon Circadian
This started out with a goal to recreate the Pebble [Fair Circadian watchface](https://setpebble.com/app/fair-circadian) by  Matthew Clark for the Bangle.js2.
It ended up with me making a mostly new watchface that has the moon phase more prominent, but keeps the single dial 24 hour clock with daylight and sunset highlighted.

## Future Development
Feature roadmap:
0.1.1 fix the layout so that the widget bar is clear;
      put sunrise/sunset at angle on sides
0.2 add Day of week and month display
1.0 Seconds display
1.1 Color Themes (and settings/options)
1.2 Moon display angle represents how it looks in the sky
1.3 custom/bigger/fitted time digits 
 
2.0 clockinfo support?
