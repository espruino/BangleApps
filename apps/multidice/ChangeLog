0.90: got most of the features done, lacking some polish and real-hardware testing
1.00: overhauled the whole app, made some margins larger to be easier to tap on
1.01: fixed bug that caused rolled dice on the right of screen to be writ off-screen
1.02: added vibration when dice is rolled
1.03: vibration caused the accelerometer to never stop
1.04: decreased vibration strength
1.05: toggled the acceleration handler to prevent infinite buzz loop
1.06: increased vibration again
1.07: IDK how to use promises properly
1.08: still trying to fix the lack of vibrations
1.09: hopefully now it's fixed?
1.10: not having web bluetooth to debug is a PAIN
1.11: decreased vibration time, decreased accel requirement
1.12: issue with app calling roll function too many times at startup
1.13: added a delay after the buzzer stops to prevent multi-rolling
1.14: made the delay needlessly long to see if it even does anything
1.15: moved accel & vibration commands to the accelHandler function
1.16: enabled button usage & temporarily disabled acceleration
1.17: made changes to when accelHandler gets overwritten, temporarily disabled button usage
1.18: decided to keep around the button even while testing, disabled all safety round the accelHandler self-triggering
1.19: added longer delay before resetting accelHandler
1.20: removed all traces of accel b/c I've given up
1.21: added a drawWidgets command to see if I have the padding right
1.22: ok the buzzing *might* work now
1.23: forgot to resolve the promise
1.24: fixed dumb errors
1.25: god I hope this works
1.26: trying to add timeout after it's done buzzing... again
1.27: OH GOD IT FINALLY WORKS
1.28: increased vibration strength, added some comments, & some QOL
1.29: changed image
1.30: changed image, again
