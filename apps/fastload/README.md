# Fastload Utils

*EXPERIMENTAL* Use this with caution. When you find something misbehaving please check if the problem actually persists when removing this app.

This allows fast loading of all apps with two conditions:
* Loaded app contains `Bangle.loadWidgets`. This is needed to prevent problems with apps not expecting widgets to be already loaded.
* Current app can be removed completely from RAM.

## Settings

* Activate app history and navigate back through recent apps instead of immediately loading the clock face
* If Quick Launch is installed it can be excluded from app history
* Allows to redirect all loads usually loading the clock to the launcher instead
* The "Fastloading..." screen can be switched off
* Enable checking `setting.json` and force a complete load on changes

## App history

* Long press of hardware button clears the app history and loads the clock face
* Installing the 'Fast Reset' app allows doing fastloads directly to the clock face by pressing the hardware button just a little longer than a click. Useful if there are many apps in the history and the user want to access the clock quickly.

## Technical infos

This is still experimental but it uses the same mechanism as `.bootcde` does.
It checks the app to be loaded for widget use and stores the result of that and a hash of the js in a cache.
