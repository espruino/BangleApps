# Thyttan's Default Config

A different default set of apps and configurations. Makes many quality of life changes. Opinionated based on the creators taste. Read more below before installing.

## Usage

Before installing do this:

1. Backup your current setup (via the "More..." tab of the App Loader) so you can restore it later if you want.
2. Install this app (you'll be prompted about all data being removed from your Bangle)
3. Try it out, switch out apps to your favorites and tweak to your liking!

## Features

There will not be a trace of a "Thyttan's Default Config" app on your watch after installation. Only the apps it installed and the configurations.

On the clock face:
- Swipe right on the screen to open the launcher (Desktop Launcher) - or press the hardware button.
- Swipe left to open a flashlight app.
- Swipe up to open the messages.
- Swipe down for quick access to music and podcast controls.
  - (Do a subsequent left or right swipe to enter the listed apps)
- (Check out the "Quick Launch" app readme for more info)

Miscellaneous:
- The bluetooth indicator will be hidden when connected, visible if not (`widbt_notify`).
- Messages can be scrolled by a twist of the arm (if they were auto-displayed).
