## Usage

You can use Choozi to pick a person to play first in a board game. With all
the players seated in a circle, set the number of segments equal to the number
of players, ensure that each person knows which colour represents them, and then
choose a segment. After a short animation, the chosen segment will fill the screen.

You can use Choozi to randomly select an element from any set with 2 to 15 members,
as long as you can define a bijection between members of the set and coloured
segments on the Bangle.js display.
