# Run App

Displays distance, time, steps, cadence, pace and heart rate for runners. Based on the Run app, but extended with additional screen for heart rate based training, based on the Karvonnen calculation method.
It requires the input of your minimum and maximum heart rate in the settings for the app to work. You can come back back to the initial run screen anytime by swimping left.
To use it, start the app and press the middle button so that the red STOP in the bottom right turns to a green `RUN`.

## Display 1st screen

* `DIST` - the distance travelled based on the GPS (if you have a GPS lock).
  * NOTE: this is based on the GPS coordinates which are not 100% accurate, especially initially. As
  the GPS updates your position as it gets more satellites your position changes and the distance
  shown will increase, even if you are standing still.
* `TIME` - the elapsed time for your run
* `PACE` - the number of minutes it takes you to run a given distance, configured in settings (default 1km) **based on your run so far**
* `HEART (BPM)` - Your current heart rate
* `Max BPM` - Your maximum heart rate reached during the run
* `STEPS` - Steps since you started exercising
* `CADENCE` - Steps per second based on your step rate *over the last minute*
* `GPS` - this is green if you have a GPS lock. GPS is turned on automatically
so if you have no GPS lock you just need to wait.
* The current time is displayed right at the bottom of the screen
* `RUN/STOP` - whether the distance for your run is being displayed or not

## Display 2nd screen

Unlock the screen and navigate between displays by swiping left or right.
The upper number is the limit before next heart rate zone. The lower number is the limit before previous heart rate zone. The number in the middle is the heart rate. The Z1 to Z5 number indicates the heart rate zone where you are. The circle provides a quick visualisation of the hr zone in which you are.

## Recording Tracks

When the `Recorder` app is installed, `Run` will automatically start and stop tracks
as needed, prompting you to overwrite or begin a new track if necessary.

## Settings

Under `Settings` -> `App` -> `Run` you can change settings for this app.

* `Record Run` (only displayed if `Recorder` app installed) should the Run app automatically
record GPS/HRM/etc data every time you start a run?
* `Pace` is the distance that pace should be shown over - 1km, 1 mile, 1/2 Marathon or 1 Marathon
* `Boxes` leads to a submenu where you can configure what is shown in each of the 6 boxes on the display.
 Available stats are "Time", "Distance", "Steps", "Heart (BPM)", "Max BPM", "Pace (avg)", "Pace (curr)", "Speed", and "Cadence".
 Any box set to "-" will display no information.
    * Box 1 is the top left (defaults to "Distance")
    * Box 2 is the top right (defaults to "Time")
    * Box 3 is the middle left (defaults to "Pace (avg)")
    * Box 4 is the middle right (defaults to "Heart (BPM)")
    * Box 5 is the bottom left (defaults to "Steps")
    * Box 6 is the bottom right (defaults to "Cadence")
* `Notifications` leads to a submenu where you can configure if the app will notify you after
your distance, steps, or time repeatedly pass your configured thresholds
    * `Ntfy Dist`: The distance that you must pass before you are notified. Follows the `Pace` options
        * "Off" (default), "1km", "1 mile", "1/2 Marathon", "1 Marathon"
    * `Ntfy Steps`: The number of steps that must pass before you are notified.
        * "Off" (default), 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000
    * `Ntfy Time`: The amount of time that must pass before you are notified.
        * "Off" (default), "30 sec", "1 min", "2 min", "5 min", "10 min", "30 min", "1 hour"
    * `Dist Pattern`: The vibration pattern to use to notify you about meeting your distance threshold
    * `Step Pattern`: The vibration pattern to use to notify you about meeting your step threshold
    * `Time Pattern`: The vibration pattern to use to notify you about meeting your time threshold
    * `min hr`: Input your minimum heart rate (measure it as you wake up, prior to any movement)
    * `max hr`: Input your maximum heart rate

## TODO

* Keep a log of each run's stats (distance/steps/time in each hr zone/etc)

## Development

This app uses the [`exstats` module](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/blob/master/modules/exstats.js). When uploaded via the
app loader, the module is automatically included in the app's source. However
when developing via the IDE the module won't get pulled in by default.

There are some options to fix this easily - please check out the [modules README.md file](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/blob/master/modules/README.md)
