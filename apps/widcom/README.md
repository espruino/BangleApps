# Compass Power Status Widget

A simple widget that shows the on/off status of the compass.

The compass draws around 1mA when on.  Whilst this is not a big draw
on the battery it is still easy to have it switched on and not be
aware.

- Uses Bangle.isCompassOn(), requires firmware v2.08.167 or later
- Shows in grey when the compass is off
- Shows in amber when the compass is on
