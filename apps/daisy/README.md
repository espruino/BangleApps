  *A beautiful digital clock with large ring guage, idle timer and a
   cyclic information line that includes, day, date, steps, battery,
   sunrise and sunset times*

* Derived from `The Ring` proof of concept and the [Pastel clock](https://banglejs.com/apps/?q=pastel)
* Includes the [Lazybones](https://banglejs.com/apps/?q=lazybones) Idle warning timer
* Touch the top right/top left to cycle through the info display (Day, Date, Steps, Sunrise, Sunset)
* Uses mylocation.json from MyLocation app to calculate sunrise and sunset times for your location
* The screen is updated every minute to save battery power
* Uses the [BloggerSansLight](https://www.1001fonts.com/rounded-fonts.html?page=3) font, which if free for commercial use

## Future Development
* Add settings menu to change primary clock color
* Add a heart rate option in the information line that turns on when selected
* Use mini icons in the information line rather that text
* Add weather icons as per Pastel clock
* Add a lock icon to the screen
