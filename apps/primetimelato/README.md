# Prime Lato (clock)

A watchface that displays time and its prime factors in the Lato font.
For example when the time is 21:05, the prime factors are 5,421.
Displays 'Prime Time!' when the time is a prime number.

There is a settings option added in the Settings App.  If 'Buzz on
Prime' is ticked then the buzzer will sound when 'Prime Time!' is
detected.  Note the buzzer is limited to between 8am and 8pm so it
should not go off when you want to sleep.
