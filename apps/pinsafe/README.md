# PIN safe
Stores several encrypted PINs on your watch. You can use one key to decode them all.
This is safe, as long as:
- None of the PINs can be guessed by a brute force attack.
- All of the PINs are random.
- Your key is long enough (preferably as long as your PINs).

This app requires a keyboard!
