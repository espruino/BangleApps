# Backswipe edge

Go back by swiping from the right edge of the screen, Android style.

To trigger a backswipe, you have to start at the right edge of the screen, swipe to the left until you feel a tiny buzz and let go. To cancel a backswipe, move your finger to the right until you feel another tiny buzz and let go.

This fires an event `Bangle.backswipe`.
