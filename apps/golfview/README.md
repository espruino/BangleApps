- See official mapping guidelines [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure%3Dgolf_course).
- All holes and features must be within the target course's area.
- Supported features are greens, fairways, tees, bunkers, water hazards and holes.
- All features for a given hole should have the "ref" tag with the hole number as value. Shared features should list ref values separated by ';'. [example](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/36896320).
- here must be 18 holes and they must have the following tags: handicap, par, ref, dist.
