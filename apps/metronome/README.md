# Metronome

This metronome makes your watch blink and vibrate with a given rate.

## Usage

* Tap the screen at least three times. The app calculates the mean rate of your tapping. This rate is displayed in bmp while the text blinks and the watch softly vibrates with every beat.
* Use `BTN1` to increase the bmp value by one.
* Use `BTN3` to decrease the bmp value by one.
* You can change the bpm value any time by tapping the screen or using `BTN1` and `BTN3`.
* Intensity of buzzing and the beats per bar (default 4) can be changed with the settings-app. The first beat per bar will be marked in red.
