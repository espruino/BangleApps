A clock that calculates the time difference between now (in blue/cyan) and any given target date (in red/orange).

The results is show in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds. The seconds can be shown:
- always
- when the watch is unlocked
- never.

The time difference is positive if the target date is in the past and negative if it is in the future.
