# Waternet
This is the Bangle Js 2 version of my Waternet game which is a multi platform puzzle game initially written for old consoles and handhelds.

## Game Modes
The aim of the game, in any game mode is always to connect all pipes so that water can flow through them from the water point source. How you can accomplish this depends on the  game mode. The game has a help section in the main menu where you can always check up on the rules of each game mode.

### Rotate Mode
![rotate legend](rotate-legend.png) ![rotate finish](rotate-finish.png) ![rotate](rotate.png) 

You need to connect all the pipes so water flows through them, by touching the middle of the screen when the selector is on a pipe, to rotate the single pipe.

### Slide Mode
![slide legend](slide-legend.png) ![slide finish](slide-finish.png) ![slide](slide.png)

You need to connect all the pipes so water flows through them, by touching the middle of the screen when the selector is on the arrows of a row or column. The row or column will move all pipes in the direction the arrow is pointing at.

### Roslid Mode

You need to connect all the pipes so water flows through them, by touching the middle of the screen when the selector is on the arrows of a row or column. The row or column will move all pipes in the direction the arrow is pointing at. You can also touch the middle of the screen when the selector is on a pipe, to rotate the single pipe. This is a combination Rotate and Slide mode.

## Credits
Waternet game concept is based on the Net and Netslide game from the [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/),
it's my own re-implementation of these two game concepts mixed into one game
