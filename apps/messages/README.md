# Messages library

This library handles the passing of messages. It can stores a list of messages
and allows them to be retrieved by other apps.

## Example

Assuming you are using GadgetBridge and "overlay notifications":

1. Gadgetbridge sends an event to your watch for an incoming message
2. The `android` app parses the message, and calls `require("messages").pushMessage({/** the message */})`
3. `require("messages")` calls `Bangle.emit("message", "text", {/** the message */})`
4. Overlay Notifications shows the message in an overlay, and marks it as `handled`
5. The default UI app (Message UI, `messagegui`) sees the event is marked as `handled`, so does nothing.
6. The default widget (`widmessages`) does nothing with `handled`, and shows a notification icon.
7. You tap the notification, in order to open the full GUI: Overlay Notifications
   calls `require("messages").openGUI({/** the message */})`
8. `openGUI` calls `require("messagegui").open(/** copy of the message */)`.
9. The `messagegui` library loads the Message UI app.



## Events

When a new message arrives, a `"message"` event is emitted, you can listen for
it like this:

```js
myMessageListener = Bangle.on("message", (type, message)=>{
  if (message.handled) return; // another app already handled this message
  // <type> is one of "text", "call", "alarm", "map", or "music"
  // see `messages/lib.js` for possible <message> formats
  // message.t could be "add", "modify" or "remove"
  E.showMessage(`${message.title}\n${message.body}`, `${message.t} ${type} message`);
  // You can prevent the default `message` app from loading by setting `message.handled = true`:
  message.handled = true;
});
```

Apps can launch the currently installed Message GUI by calling `require("messages").openGUI()`.
If you want to write your own GUI, it should include a library called `messagegui`
with a method called `open` that will cause it to be opened, with the
optionally supplied message. See `apps/messagegui/lib.js` for an example.


## Settings

You can configure settings by going to `Settings ->  Apps -> Messages`

There are several options to choose from:

* **Vibrate** : Vibration pattern to use for messages
* **Vibrate for calls** : Vibration pattern to use for calls
* **Repeat** : How many times to vibrate for messages
* **Repeat for calls** : How many times to vibrate for calls
* **Vibrate timer** : How many seconds should we vibrate for?
* **Unread timer** : How long should the Messages app show an unread message for before going back to the clock?
* **Min Font** : Minimum font size for messages
* **Auto-Open Music** : Should the messages music screen auto open when music is played?
* **Unlock Watch** : When a message arrives should the watch be unlocked?
* **Flash Icon** : Should the messages icon in the widget flash when a message arrives?
* **Quiet mode disables auto-open** : When in quiet mode, should we not open the messages app for new messages?
* **Disable auto-open** : Should we not open the messages app for new messages?
* **Widget messages** : How many message icons should the widget show?
* **Icon color mode** : Should icons in widgets be coloured?
* **Car driver pos** : What side of the car is the driver on? This affects navigation icons for roundabouts
