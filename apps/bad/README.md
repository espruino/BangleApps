# Bad Apple demo ![](app.png)

"Bad Apple" is like "Hello World" for graphics system. So this is it
for Bangle.js2. Watch have no speaker, so vibration motor is used,
instead, to produce (pretty quiet) sound.

Tools for preparing bad.araw and bad.vraw are in prep/ directory. Full
3 minute demo should actually fit to the watch.
