# Running

This app is designed to be simple and intuitive.  
I’ve tried to make everything as clear as possible.

## How to Use

When you open the app, you have two options:

- **Run** – start a new running session.  
- **Results** – view your previous runs.

## Run

When you tap **Run**, you’ll see four squares with a red one in the middle.  

- To start running, press **Button 1** on the side of your **Bangle.js**.  
  The middle square will turn **green**, indicating that recording has started.  

- To stop, press the same button again.  
  The screen will freeze, showing that the session has ended.  

To view your results, reopen the app and choose **Results**.

## Results

In the **Results** screen, you’ll see a list of your runs sorted by date.  
Tap any date to view detailed data for that session.  

You can also view or download your results directly from the **App Loader**.

## Notes

- Make sure your **GPS** is active before starting a run. It is ready when the distance and speed starts changing.
- Recorded data includes time, distance, heart rate, ...  
- Results are saved on the watch and can be exported for analysis.
