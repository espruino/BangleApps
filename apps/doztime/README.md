Dozenal Time
============

A dozenal Holocene calendar and a dozenal diurnal clock. For information about them, go to https://dozenal.ae-web.ca/pdf/dozenal-calendar.pdf and https://dozenal.ae-web.ca/pdf/about-short.pdf. They've been in use for some years.

In the dozenal number base, ten and eleven are single digits, and 10 is a dozen. The clock simply divides the day by successive powers of a dozen. The day or parts of it may be divided easily into halves, thirds, quarters, sixths, or twelfths (dozenths). There is no conglomeration of bases two, ten, twelve, and sixty, as in the current system of time measurement.

The annual calendar has a dozen months of 5 weeks each, each week having 6 days. The 5 or 6 days beyond 360 (dozenal 260) are added where they keep the season beginnings the most accurate.

The year itself begins on the December solstice. Because that always happens, there is no need of a leap-year rule to keep the seasons from drifting.

The epoch (year numbering) begins in the last year when the perihelion coincided with the June solstice, near the beginning of the Holocene era. That astronomical basis makes the calendar free from politics, religion, or geography.

While the year number remains cardinal, BTN5 toggles between cardinal and ordinal for the rest of the calendar segments. BTN4 adds or removes a quickly changing digit to or from the clock.
