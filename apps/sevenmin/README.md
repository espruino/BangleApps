Do a seven minute workout - or three!

Touch the screen to start the workout and follow the instructions.

Once the workout is finished the screen can be touched to go again - but get a minute or two of rest inbetween!

Search the web if you want further instructions, videos are helpful!

TODO:
- Add visible countdowns
- Add tracking of excercises, number of repetitions done etc. (Integration with BanglExercise app?)
- Add tracking of workouts over time.
- Move the whole app into BangleExercise app?
