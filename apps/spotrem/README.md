Requires Gadgetbridge 71.0 or later. Allow intents in Gadgetbridge in order for this app to work.

Touch input:

Press the different ui elements to control Podcast Addict and open menus. Press left or right arrow to go to previous/next track.

Swipe input:

Swipe left/right to go to previous/next track. Swipe up/down to change the volume.

It's possible to start tracks by searching with the remote. Search term without tags will override search with tags.

To start playing 'from cold' the command for previous/next track via touch or swipe can be used. Pressing just play/pause is not guaranteed to initiate spotify in all circumstances (this will probably change with subsequent releases).

In order to search to play or start music from the 'Saved' menu the Android device must be awake and unlocked. The remote can wake and unlock the device if the Bangle.js has been added as a 'trusted device' under Android Settings->Security->Smart Lock->Trusted devices.

The swipe logic was inspired by the implementation in [rigrig](https://git.tubul.net/rigrig/)'s Scrolling Messages.
