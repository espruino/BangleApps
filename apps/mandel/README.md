# Mandel

Draw a colored rendition of the famous Mandelbrot set. Pushing button 2 activates zoom mode: the top and left edge of the zoom region can be moved up/down
with buttons 1 and 3 and left/right by touching the screen left right. Pushing button 2 again allows movement of the bottom and right edge in the same manner.
Pushing button 2 a third time renders the selected region full screen.

The code uses inlined C code for perfomance reasons. Full source is provided on github.
