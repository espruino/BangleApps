# Ultra Info Clock
For those who crave a clock with information, this clock has 6 clockInfos. Uses `ClockBG` module for enhanced clock backgrounds.

Additionally, each clockInfo has a bar at the bottom, and if the clockInfo on display has a `max` value, it displays a progress meter there. (Steps, heart rate, altitude, etc.)

No widgets are loaded or displayed, as the 24px of space is needed for the ClockInfos, and many clockInfos show the same info that the widget bar can as well. (Bluetooth, Messages, etc.)
## Settings:
- `Main Color` - The main color of clockInfos, progress bar backgrounds, and text
- `Accent Color` - The color of the progress bars and ClockInfos when focused.
