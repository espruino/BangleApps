Astronomical clock.

Written by: [Pavel Machek](https://github.com/pavelmachek)

The plan is to have an (analog) astronomical clock with a lot of
information on single dial.

It continuously displays information that can be obtained "cheaply",
that is current time, sunset/sunrise times, battery status and
altitude. One-second updates with useful compass can be activated by
tapping bottom right corner.

Display is split in three rings. Outside ring is for time-based data
with base of one week, and for non time-based data. Black dot
indicates day of week. Green foot indicates number of steps taken, red
battery symbol indicates remaining charge, black thermometer symbol
represents temperature, and black ruler symbol indicates
altitude. Number in bottom left corner is day of month.

In the middle ring, hour-based data are displayed. Black dot indicates
current hour, yellow symbols indicate sunset and sunrise, and black
symbols indicate moonset and moonrise.
