# pooq Round: a maximally readable, naturally 24hr, analogue watch face

This is a normal watch face for telling the time.
It is unusual in that it uses a pie chart for the hour hand. This is much easier and
more precise to read at a glance than a conventional hand, and as a bonus can distinguish
midnight (all black) from noon (all white).

The day and date are optionally displayed, typographically smooshed into the corners.
Either you'll like that, or you won't.

## Options

Although we generally obey the system-wide theming, you can long press on the display for a menu of additional options specific to the face.
We don't observe the system 12/24 setting, since it the design of the face is equally good in either interpretation.

If you like an uncluttered display style, you can still bring up the day, date and minute hand transiently with a tap on the watchface (when unlocked).

Similarly, because sometimes I don't want to burn what I'm cooking and others I'm lazy and just want to know if it's afternoon yet,
you can quickly alter the number of ‘hands’ on the display. When the watch is unlocked, slide up to add dots representing the minute and second,
or down to remove the distraction. There's also a setting that displays the second hand, but only if the watch is perfectly face-to-the-sky,
in case you want the ability to check the _exact_ time, hands free, without the impact on battery life this usually entails.

In some versions of the Bangle.js firmware, the backlight doesn't come on automatically when you twist your wrist. There's currently a workaround 
for this integrated into the watchface; you can disable it in the menu, if you prefer.

## Limitations

Since this is intended as a design exercise, it does not and will probably never support the Bangle's standard widgets.
Sorry about that, but control of all the pixels was just too important to me.

There's also no support for internationalisation at present. This irks me, but since every month and day name is hand-drawn, 
there's no fix other than hard work. Talk to me about it if there's a language you'd like.
