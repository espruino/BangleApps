## BTN2 Long press to start the launcher

BTN2 is confiured to respond to a 1.5 second press in order to switch
to the launcher App. Simply press and hold until you hear a buzz and
release. This avoids accidently switching out of the watch app when
clothing catches it.

## Notes

* Uses an arrayBuffer to prepare the doughnut guage. The arrayBuffer
  is 160*160 and is larger than required. The reason for this is that
  I plan to use this watch face with others in a multiclock format
  and want to be able to reuse the arrayBuffer with other clocks.
