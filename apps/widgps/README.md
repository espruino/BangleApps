# GPS Power Status Widget

A simple widget that shows the on/off status of the GPS.

The GPS can quickly run the battery down if it is on all the time so
it is useful to know if it has been switched on or not.

- Uses Bangle.isGPSOn()
- Shows in grey when the GPS is off
- Shows in amber when the GPS is on
