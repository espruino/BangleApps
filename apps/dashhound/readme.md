# Dash Hound
This is a side scrolling endless runner game. The main character is Dash the dachshund.
Dash loves running in the hot dessert climates and making daring leaps of cacti at high speed.
Help Dash jump those cacti, make sure he doesn't land on one or run into one, otherwise he'll explode!
Happy Hounding :D
