# Clock Info Launcher

This app allow you to add new Clock Info items that will launch a specific app.

## Usage

When the app is installed, go to `Settings -> Apps -> ClkInfo Launch` to set it up.

Here, you'll see any app launchers you have made so far. Click `Add Button` to add a new button, and choose an app from the list that appears.

A menu will pop up letting you customise the button - the name (which'll appear under the Clock Info) is pre-filled with the app name, and you can choose from a series of icons provided by the `icons` module.

* `Icon` - the picture for the button
* `Name` - the name associated with the button

Once you've saved, your icon will appear as a ClockInfo in your clock, and tapping on it will launch that app.
