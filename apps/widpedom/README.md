# Pedometer widget

Daily pedometer widget that can display steps in large/small size, and also your progress towards a step goal.

## Usage

Once installed, the pedometer will display the step count in the top left of the watch (when widgets are displayed)

On 2v29 and later firmwares, tapping on the widget with the watch unlocked will make it buzz and cause the steps to go grey, which will disable step detection. Tapping again will re-enable it.

## Settings

This app has a settings screen (under `Settings -> Apps -> Pedometer widget`)

* `Daily Goal` - set how many steps your goal for the day is. The Bangle will buzz when the goal is reached.
* `Show Progress` - show progress towards the step goal in the widget bar
* `Large Digits` - show large digits for the step counter rather than small ones
* `Hide Widget` - don't show the widget. Normally in this case we'd suggest just uninstalling the widget, but keeping it installed but hidden will allow the Bangle to buzz when your step goal is reached.
