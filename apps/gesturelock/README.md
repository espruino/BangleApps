# Gesture Lock

## WARNING: Might rewrite any current AI models on your watch! 

Uses a pre-trained machine learning gesture model to lock the bangle.

If you want to record some data to be trained in the next version of the model for greater gesture compatibility, or want to see new gestures / features, go to the discussion here: [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/espruino/discussions/7808)

This app is intended to see what AI models can run on the Bangle.js, and how it can help users daily.
