Enton - Enhanced Anton Clock

This clock face is based on the 'Anton Clock'.

Things I changed:

- The main font for the time is now Audiowide
- Removed the written out day name and replaced it with steps and bpm
- Changed the date string to a (for me) more readable string

Timer function:
- Touch the right side, to start the timer
- Initial timer timeout is 300s/5min
- Right touch again, add 300s/5min to timeout
- Left touch, decrease timeout by 60s/1min
- So it is easy, to add timeouts like 7min/3min or 12min
- Special thanks to the maintainer of the a_clock_timer app from which I borrowed the code.

Todo:
- Make displayed information configurable, after https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/issues/2226
- Clean up code
