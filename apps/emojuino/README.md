## Usage

The emoji will be recognised by [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware and any other program which observes the [InteroperaBLE Identifier](https://reelyactive.github.io/interoperable-identifier/) open standard.


## Features

Currently implements a tiny subset of possible [Unicode emojis](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) which are advertised as an [InteroperaBLE Identifier](https://reelyactive.github.io/interoperable-identifier/) encapsulated as Eddystone UID.


## Controls
