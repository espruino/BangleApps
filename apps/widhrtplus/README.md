# Heart Rate Widget+

A simple widget that shows the on/off status of the Heart Rate
Monitor and the last measured value.

- Shows in red when the HRM is on
- Shows in black or white (foreground colour) when the HRM is off
- Does not power the HRM on or off. Relies on the Health app to do that. 
- Resizes widget based on value of heart rate
- Uses Lato font so looks consistant with Lato Pedometer and Yet Another Battery Widget
