Display apps sorted by regular use. No config - install the app and all your launchers will sort apps by most popular, based off launch counts within the last month, and then sort them by the most recently launched app.

⚠️ Warning: this app overrides [`Storage.readJSON`], so may slow down your watch when using apps that perform I/O.
