# CoreTemp display

Basic bare-bones example of connecting to a bluetooth [CoreTemp](https://corebodytemp.com/) device and displaying the current body core temperature readings.

## Usage

On startup connects to a CoreTemp device (1809/2A1C) and emits a "Core, temp" value for each reading.
The app simply displays these readings on screen.

## TODO

* Integrate with other tracking/sports apps to log data.
* Add device selection
* Provide enable/disable option
* Check status, add Retry/reconnect
* Also provide skin temp reading
