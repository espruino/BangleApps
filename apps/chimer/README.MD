# Chimer - For the BangleJS

A fork of [Hour Chime](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/widchime) that adds extra features such as:

- Buzz or beep on every 60, 30 or 15 minutes.
- Repeat Chime up to 3 times
- Set hours to disable chime

Setting the hours you don't want your watch to chime for is done by setting the hour you want it to stop, and the hour you want it to start.

Hours range from 0 - 23.
