# Calorie Tracker
Tracks calories using [`MyProfile`](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=myprofile) data, and a sophisticated formula that takes age, gender, weight, height, heart rate, and steps into account. 
This app also ties in with the [`Health App`](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=health) for greater integration within the Bangle.js ecosystem.
