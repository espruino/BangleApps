This first release seems servicable in testing so far.

To get the standard menu scrolling back, just remove this app from your Bangle.

TODO:
- Maybe have how much of "trailing space" there are after the last entry should be dynamic in size, now it's always 8 pixels which corresponds to if there are a widget field and a menu title present.
- I want to change the size of menu entries to be a little bigger vertically.
