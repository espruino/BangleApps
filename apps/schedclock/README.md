# Schedule Clock Faces

Change clock faces on a schedule.

For example: a fun clock face for weekends and after work; a detailed clock face for work days.

## Usage

* Open the `Schedule Clock` app or find it in the `Settings` > `Apps` menu.
* Set `Enabled` to checked
* Select `Add New` to add a new scheduled face change
* Select the `Day`, `Hour`, `Minute`, and what `Clock` to change to
* Select `Save` to save the new (or changed) schedule

An entry in `Scheduler` will be created for each scheduled clock change.

If the clockface you selected has been uninstalled, the schedule will still exist but won't do anything.

## To Uninstall
Before uninstalling this app, clean up any scheduled alarms by setting the `Enabled` toggle to unchecked.

If you skip this step, orphaned alarms may cause error logs but won't affect functionality.

You can also remove the extra `schedclock` alarms manually with the [Scheduler](/?id=sched) app.
