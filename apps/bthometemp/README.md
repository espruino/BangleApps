# BTHome Temperature and Pressure

This app displays temperature and pressure and advertises them over bluetooth using BTHome.io standard (along with battery level)

This can be used to integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), so you can use your Bangle as a wireless temperature/pressure sensor.

More info on the standard at https://bthome.io

And the data format used is https://bthome.io/format/
