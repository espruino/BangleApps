# Code Load

This allows running arm binaries as an application on
Bangle.js2. Obvious use is to run C code, and example doing that is
provided, but you should be able to run other languages, too, as long
as you can provide suitable binary (and fit within constraints), and
hack suitable basic library.

Binary code can ask javascript to do "stuff" on its behalf, currently
it can display text and display bitmap.
