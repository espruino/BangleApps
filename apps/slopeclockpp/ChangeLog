0.01: Clone of original SlopeClock
0.02: Added configuration
0.03: Reset font to save some memory during remove
0.04: Changed to use clock_info for displayed data
      Made fonts smaller to avoid overlap when (eg) 22:00
      Allowed black/white background (as that can look nice too)
0.05: Images in clkinfo are optional now
