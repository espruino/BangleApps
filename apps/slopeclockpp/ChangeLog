0.01: Clone of original SlopeClock
0.02: Added configuration
0.03: Reset font to save some memory during remove

0.05: Images in clkinfo are optional now
0.06: Added support for locale based time
0.07: README file update as UI interaction was not easy to understand
0.08: Stability improvements - ensure we continue even if a flat string can't be allocated
      Stop ClockInfo text drawing outside the allocated area
0.09: Use clock_info module as an app
0.10: Option to hide widgets, tweak top widget width to avoid overlap with hour text at 9am
