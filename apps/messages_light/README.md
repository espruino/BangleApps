# Messages app

This app handles the display of messages and message notifications. 

It is a GUI replacement for the  `messages` apps.


To work, you must install:
- Messages
- Messages UI
- Messages Light (obviously)

The Messages UI is recalled for the management of the "Music" notification (up to implementing a dedicated app)

Thanks to @halemmerich for having "reviewed" the code. I applied some of your changes.
