# Big Clock Info app

For die hard clock info fans...

## Features

All the clock infos you have installed displayed full screen.

## Controls

Interact with it like one big clock info, which it is!

## Settings

TBA: Should the app be treated as a clock face app?

## Potential Improvements

- Tweak size of icon vs text box.
- Add backgrounds library and use clockinfo drawBorderedImage.
  - should it be a dependency or should there be conditional implementation where it's alright to go with or without?
- Could the clock clkinfo icon be made dynamic to show the actual time. That would be neat.
  - either native implementation in `bigclkinfo` or through `clkinfoclk` app dependency.

## Requests

Open an issue on the espruino/BangleApps issue tracker mentioning @thyttan.
