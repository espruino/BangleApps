Differences from the original LCD Clock:

* Two extra (4 total) ClockInfo areas at the bottom of the screen. ClockInfo areas are now smaller and only include the icon and the data.
* AM/PM labels moved to the right of the time and are only visible when 12-hour mode is enabled in the system locale settings.
* Month name label added.
* Background color changed to better mimic old-style LCD screens.
* Various small alignment ajustments.
