# Ohm's Law Calculator

This is a simple and intuitive Ohm's Law Calculator application designed for the Bangle.js 2 Smartwatch. The calculator focuses on providing an easy-to-navigate user interface with automatic calculation logic, allowing you to quickly and efficiently calculate electrical measurements, including Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Power.

## Usage Guide

* __Select the Electrical Measurement:__ On the main menu, select the electrical measurement that you wish to calculate (Voltage, Current, Resistance, or Power).
* __Enter Known Values:__ You will then be prompted to enter the known values. The application will present a menu listing the remaining electrical measurements. Select one and you will be taken to a numeric input screen. Repeat this step for the second known value.
* __View Results:__ Once the two known values have been entered, the application will automatically calculate and display the value of the selected electrical measurement. The Results menu will show the calculated value, the unit of measurement, and the formula used for calculation.
* __Navigation:__ Whether you're deep in calculations or perusing the results, the power to navigate the app remains in your hands. While the 'Back' button is present in most scenarios, it isn't available in the Results menu and the Input screen. However, you can always return to the beginning by selecting 'Main Menu' from the Results menu. And if you're on the numeric Input screen, simply hold down the 'Clear' button to navigate back.
