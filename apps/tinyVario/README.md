# Turn your Bangle.js2 into a flight computer!

All settings can be accessed by touching the corresponding data fields. I made all interface objects as big as possible to make it easier to use with gloves. 

## This is a work in progress. Working features so far:
- Altimeter
- Variometer
- Average rate of climb
- Ground speed
- Flying time with automatic take-off detection


## Planned features:
- glide slope display
- final glide computer
- waypoint navigation
- flight log (possibly IGC file export)

Contact me for feedback and suggestions!
