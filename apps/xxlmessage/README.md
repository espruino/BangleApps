# XXL Message app
This app displays an incomming message with a very large
font and scrolls the text. For people who can't read the
menu font without glasses, this might be an alternative
to the default messages UI app.

When arrived, new messages are displayed instantly on the screen.
When the message fully scrolled two times or
if you touch the screen or press the button,
the default clock is loaded.

Nothing more, nothing less.
