# Sensor tools

This allows to simulate sensor behaviour for development purposes


## Per Sensor settings:

enabled:
  true or false
mode:
  emulate: Completely craft events for this sensor
  modify: Take existing events from real sensor and modify their data
name:
  name of the emulation or modification mode
power:
  emulate: Simulate Bangle._PWR changes, but do not call real power function
  nop: Do nothing, ignore all power calls for this sensor but return true
  passthrough: Just pass all power calls unmodified
  on: Do not allow switching the sensor off, all calls are switching the real sensor on

### HRM

Modes: modify, emulate
Modification:
  bpmtrippled: Multiply the bpm value of the original HRM values with 3
Emulation:
  sin: Calculate bpm changes by using sin

### GPS

Modes: emulate
Emulation:
  staticfix: static complete fix with all values
  route: A square route starting in the SW corner and moving SW->NW->NO->SW...
  routeFuzzy: Roughly the same square as route, but with 100m seqments with some variaton in course
  nofix: All values NaN but time,sattelites,fix and fix == 0
  changingfix: A fix with randomly changing values

### Compass

Modes: emulate
Emulation:
  static: All values but heading are 1, heading == 0
  rotate: All values but heading are 1, heading rotates 360Â°
