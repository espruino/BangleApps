This app will allow you to keep scores for most kinds of sports.

# Keybinds
To correct a falsely awarded point simply open and close the menu within .5 seconds. This will put the app into correction mode (indicated by the `R`).
In this mode any score increments will be decrements. To move back a set, reduce both players scores to 0, then decrement one of the scores once again.

The settings can be changed both from within the app by simply pressing `BTN2` (`BTN1` on Bangle.js 2) or in the `App Settings` in the `Settings` app.

If changes are made to the settings from within the app, a new match will automatically be initialized upon exiting the settings.

By default the settings will reflect Badminton rules.

## Tennis Scoring
While tennis scoring is available, correcting in this mode will reset to the beginning of the current game.
Resetting at the beginning of the current game will reset to the beginning of the previous game, leaving the user to fast-forward to the correct score once again.

This might get changed at some point.
