# Medical Alert Widget

Shows a medical alert logo in the top right widget area, and a medical alert message in the bottom widget area.

**Note:** this is not a replacement for a medical alert band but hopefully a useful addition.

## Features

Implemented:

- Basic medical alert logo and message
- Only display bottom widget on clocks
- High contrast colours depending on theme

Future:

- Configure when to show bottom widget (always/never/clocks)
- Configure medical alert text
- Show details when touched
