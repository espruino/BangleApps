## Measurements from left to right:

<!-- HRM and Temperature are commented out (they didn't seem very useful)
- Current heart rate, on a scale from 0-200 bpm (*red*)<br>
  Only if available: this widget does not turn on HRM monitoring by itself.
- Device temperature, on a scale from 0-50 Â°C (*yellow*)
-->

- Flash storage space used (_blue/cyan_)
- Memory usage (_magenta_)
- Battery charge (_green_)
