# Shortcuts

An app that allows you to create custom ClockInfos that act as shortcuts to your favourite apps.

## Create a Shortcut
After installing the app, you can open the app to add and manage existing shortcuts. If no shortcuts exist, the app will display a ``[+] Shortcuts`` button as a ClockInfo on your Clock (see screenshots), which when clicked will quickly launch into the app so you can add new shortcuts.

When adding a shortcut, first select the app you wish to use, then select the icon you wish to register to the shortcut. If a keyboard is installed, you'll get the option to rename the shortcut before saving.

Once created, your shortcut will appear on any Clocks with ClockInfo support, and tapping the shortcut will launch the chosen app
