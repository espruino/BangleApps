# Settings

This is Bangle.js's settings menu

* **Make Connectable** regardless of the current Bluetooth settings, makes Bangle.js so you can connect to it (while the window is up)
* **App/Widget Settings** settings specific to installed applications
* **BLE** is Bluetooth LE enabled and the watch connectable?
* **Programmable** if BLE is on, can the watch be connected to in order to program/upload apps?
* **Debug Info** should debug info be shown on the watch's screen or not?
* **Beep** most Bangle.js do not have a speaker inside, but they can use the vibration motor to beep in different pitches. You can change the behaviour here to use a Piezo speaker if one is connected
* **Vibration** enable/disable the vibration motor
* **Locale** set time zone/whether the clock is 12/24 hour (for supported clocks)
* **Select Clock** if you have more than one clock face, select the default one
* **HID** When Bluetooth is enabled, Bangle.js can appear as a Bluetooth Keyboard/Joystick/etc to send keypresses to a connected device. **Note:** on some platforms enabling HID can cause you problems when trying to connect to Bangle.js to upload apps.
* **Set Time** Configure the current time - Note that this can be done much more easily by choosing 'Set Time' from the App Loader
* **LCD** Configure settings about the screen. How long it stays on, how bright it is, and when it turns on.
* **Reset Settings** Reset the settings to defaults
* **Turn Off** Turn Bangle.js off
