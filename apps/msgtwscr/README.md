# Message Scroll on Twist

Temporarily activate scroll on twist function when a new message triggers the message app. This way it's possible to scroll through a message in the message scroller hands free.

## Usage

This is a bootloader app and only needs to be installed to add the functionality to the watch.

## Notes

Tried with [a development version "Message UI" app](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/pull/3685) centered around the message scroller. Should work with the standard version as well.
