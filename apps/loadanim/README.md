# Loading Animations

This app adds an animation that happens while Bangle.js is loading an app. It requires 2v29+ (or 2v28 cutting edge) firmware to work.

**Note:** loading time will be slightly negatively impacted because of the extra time
taken to update the screen during the animation, but it's not likely to be more than 20% worse.

## Usage

Once installed, any app you load that doesn't 'fast load' will cause the loading animation to be displayed. For instance swapping
between the clock and launcher may not put up the loading screen, but loading an app from the launcher will.

To change the animation, go to `Settings -> Apps -> Load Anim`. There, you can tap on the `Anim` option
and can choose from different animations. Tap on one to view it, and answer `Yes` to the prompt if you wish
to use it.
