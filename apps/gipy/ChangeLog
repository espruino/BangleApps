0.01: Initial code

0.05:
	* We now buzz before reaching a waypoint.
	* Display is only updated when not locked.
	* We detect leaving path and finding path again.

0.06:
	* Special display for points with steep turns.
	* Buzz on points with steep turns and unlock.

0.07:
	* We now use orientation to detect current segment
	when segments overlap going in both directions.
	* File format is now versioned.

0.08:
	* Don't use gps course anymore but figure it from previous positions.
	* Bugfix: path colors are back.
	* Always buzz when reaching waypoint even if unlocked.

0.09:
	* We now display interest points.
	* Menu to choose which file to load.

0.10:
	* Display performances enhancement.
	* Waypoints information is embedded in file and extracted from comments on
	points.
	* Bugfix in map display (last segment was missing + wrong colors).
	* Waypoint detections using OSM + sharp angles
	* New algorith for direction detection

0.11:
	* Better fonts (more free space, still readable).
	* Display direction to nearest point when lost.
	* Display average speed.
	* Turn off gps when locked and between points

0.12:
	* Bugfix in speed computation.
	* Bugfix in current segment detection.
	* Bugfix : lost direction.
	* Larger fonts.
	* Detecting next point correctly when going back.

0.13:
	* Bugfix in lost direction.
	* Buzzing 100m ahead instead of 50m.
	* Detect sharp turns.
	* Display instant speed.
	* New instant speed algorithm.
	* Bugfix for remaining distance when going back.

0.14:
	* Detect starting distance to compute a good average speed.
	* Settings
	* Account for breaks in average speed.

0.15:
	* Record traveled distance to get a good average speed.
	* Breaks (low speed) will not count in average speed.
	* Bugfix in average speed.

0.16:
	* When lost indicates nearest point on path.
	* Rescale display if lost and too far.
	* New setting to hide points and increase display speed.
	* Speed optimisations.
	* Estimated time of Arrival/Going back.
	* Display current and next segment in red so that you know where to go.
	* Avoid angles flickering at low speed at the cost of less refresh.
	* Splash screen while waiting for gps signal.

0.17:
	* Convert Yes/No On/Off in settings to checkboxes

0.18:
	* Major rewrite of display : now tile based
	* We have a map. Never get lost again.

0.19:
	* Several fixes for osm requests and map computations
	* Display path in leaflet
	* Reduce framerate if locked
	* Stroke to move around in the map
	* Fix for missing paths in display

0.20:
	* Large display for instant speed
	* Bugfix for negative coordinates
	* Disable menu while the map is not loaded
	* Turn screen off while idling to save battery (with setting)
	* New setting : disable buzz on turns
	* New setting : turn bluetooth off to save battery
	* New setting : power screen off between points to save battery
	* Color change for lost direction (now purple)
	* Adaptive screen powersaving

0.21:
	* Jit is back for display functions (10% speed increase)
	* Store, parse and display elevation data
	* Removed 'lost' indicator (we now change position to purple when lost)
	* Powersaving fix : don't powersave when lost
	* Bugfix for negative remaining distance when going backwards
	* New settings for powersaving
	* Adjustments to powersaving algorithm

0.22:
	* Powersaving disabled by default
	* Default choice for powersaving in the settings
	* Better position in elevation profiles
	* Integrating fixes in upstream rust heatshrink crate
	* Small path optimisations with brouter (removing looplets)
	* Bugfix in nearest segment detection

0.23:
	* New display algorithm : way faster, larger roads, zooming out is now ok
	* You will need to re-generate your maps because the new algorithm uses a different scale
	* Better path simplification
	* Removed sharp turns auto-detection
	* Waypoints autodetection using the map : this will generate more points than really needed but can still be effective.
	* New option: sleep between waypoints
	* Interface: centered svg preview + display file sizes
	* Interface: disable/enable waypoints detection and elevation
	* Touching the screen when sleeping will wake up but not change screen
	* Removing footways (if bicycles not allowed) to reduce resource usage
	* Switching screen will clear the screen immediately so you can know your screen touch has been received
	
0.24:
	* Fix for loading very large files (> 65kb)
	* New menu on file selection : reverse path without waiting for file to load
	* Fix for files converted from maps2gpx : path was not reduced in size correctly
	* Experimental ski mode : have a ski slopes map
	* Fix for path projection display when lost and zoomed out

0.25: Minor code improvements

0.26: Add option to plot openstmap if installed

0.27: Support for large paths (grid sizes > 65k)

0.28: Avoid crash on negative array access
