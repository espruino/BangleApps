0.14:
	* Detect starting distance to compute a good average speed.
	* Settings
	* Account for breaks in average speed.

0.15:
	* Record traveled distance to get a good average speed.
	* Breaks (low speed) will not count in average speed.

	* Rescale display if lost and too far.
	* New setting to hide points and increase display speed.
	* Speed optimisations.
	* Estimated time of Arrival/Going back.
	* Display current and next segment in red so that you know where to go.
