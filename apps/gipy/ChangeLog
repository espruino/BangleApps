0.01: Initial code

0.05:
	* We now buzz before reaching a waypoint.
	* Display is only updated when not locked.
	* We detect leaving path and finding path again.
	* We display remaining distance to next point.

0.06:
	* Special display for points with steep turns.
	* Buzz on points with steep turns and unlock.
	* Losing gps is now displayed.

0.07:
	* We now use orientation to detect current segment
	when segments overlap going in both directions.
	* File format is now versioned.

0.08:
	* Don't use gps course anymore but figure it from previous positions.
	* Bugfix: path colors are back.
	* Always buzz when reaching waypoint even if unlocked.

0.09:
	* We now display interest points.
	* Menu to choose which file to load.

0.10:
	* Display performances enhancement.
	* Waypoints information is embedded in file and extracted from comments on
	points.
	* Bugfix in map display (last segment was missing + wrong colors).
	* Waypoint detections using OSM + sharp angles
	* New algorith for direction detection

0.11:
	* Better fonts (more free space, still readable).
	* Display direction to nearest point when lost.
	* Display average speed.
	* Turn off gps when locked and between points

0.12:
	* Bugfix in speed computation.
	* Bugfix in current segment detection.
	* Bugfix : lost direction.
	* Larger fonts.
	* Detecting next point correctly when going back.

0.13:
	* Bugfix in lost direction.
	* Buzzing 100m ahead instead of 50m.
	* Detect sharp turns.
	* Display instant speed.
	* New instant speed algorithm.
	* Bugfix for remaining distance when going back.

0.14:
	* Detect starting distance to compute a good average speed.
	* Settings
	* Account for breaks in average speed.

0.15:
	* Record traveled distance to get a good average speed.
	* Breaks (low speed) will not count in average speed.
	* Bugfix in average speed.

0.16:
	* When lost indicates nearest point on path.
	* Rescale display if lost and too far.
	* New setting to hide points and increase display speed.
	* Speed optimisations.
	* Estimated time of Arrival/Going back.
	* Display current and next segment in red so that you know where to go.
	* Avoid angles flickering at low speed at the cost of less refresh.
	* Splash screen while waiting for gps signal.
