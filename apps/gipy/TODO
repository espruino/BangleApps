*** thoughts on lcd power ***

so, i tried experimenting with turning the lcd off in order to save power.

the good news: this saves a lot. i did a 3h ride which usually depletes the battery and I still had
around two more hours to go.

now the bad news:

- i had to de-activate the twist detection : you cannot raise your watch to the eyes to turn it on.
that's because with twist detection on all road bumps turn the watch on constantly.
- i tried manual detection like :

Bangle.on('accel', function(xyz) { 

  if (xyz.diff > 0.4 && xyz.mag > 1 && xyz.z < -1.4) {
      Bangle.setLCDPower(true);
      Bangle.setLocked(false);
  }

});

this works nicely when you sit on a chair with a simulated gps signal but does not work so nicely when on the bike.
sometimes it is ok, sometimes you can try 10 times with no success.

- instead i use screen touch to turn it on. that's a bother since you need two hands but well it could be worth it.
the problem is in the delay: between 1 and 5 seconds before the screen comes back on.


my conclusion is that:

* we should not turn screen off unless we agree to have an unresponsive ui
* we should maybe autowake near segments ends and when lost 
* we should play with backlight instead

JIT: array declaration in jit is buggy
(especially several declarations)

+ try disabling gps for more powersaving

+ when you walk the direction still has a tendency to shift

+ put back foot only ways
+ put back street names
+ put back shortest paths but with points cache this time and jit
+ how to display paths from shortest path ?


misc:
+ use Bangle.project(latlong)
