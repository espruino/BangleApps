# Auto Reset

Sets a timeout to load the clock face. The timeout is stopped and started again upon user input.

## Usage

Install with app loader and Auto Reset will run in background. If you don't interact with the watch it will time out to the clock face after 10 minutes.

## TODO

- Add settings page
  - set how many minutes the timeout should count down.
  - whitelist/blacklist for apps.
