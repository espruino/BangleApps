# Agenda

Basic agenda reading the events synchronised from GadgetBridge.

### Functionalities

* List all events in the next week (or whatever is synchronized)
* Optionally view past events (until GB removes them)
* Show start time and location of the events in the list
* Show the colour of the calendar in the list
* Display description, location and calendar name after tapping on events

### Report a bug

You can easily open an issue in the espruino repo, but I won't be notified and it might take time.  
If you want a (hopefully) quicker response, just report [on my fork](https://github.com/glemco/BangleApps).

### Known Problems

Any all-day event lasts just one day: that is a GB limitation that we will likely fix in the future.
