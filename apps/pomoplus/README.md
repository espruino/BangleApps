# Pomodoro Plus

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

> The original technique has six steps:
>
> Decide on the task to be done.
> Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
> Work on the task.
> End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
> Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodori.
> After four pomodori are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
