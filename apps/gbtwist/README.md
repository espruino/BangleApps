# Gadgetbridge Twist Control

Control your music app (e.g. MortPlayer Music [a folder based, not tag based player] ) that handles multiple play-commands (same as using a single-button-headset's button to change songs) on your Gadgetbridge-connected phone.
- Activate counting for 4 seconds with a twist (beeps at start and end of counting) 
- twist multiple times for:
 play/pause (1),
 next song (2),
 prev. song (3),
 next folder (4),
 prev. folder (5),
 reset counter (6) 
- the command to be sent is shown in green
- Volume up/down is controlled by BTN1/BTN3 presses
