This clock is a Lato version of Simplest++. Simplest++ provided the
smallest example of a clock that supports 'fast load' and 'clock
info'.  Lato takes this one step further and adds the lovely Lato
font.  The clock is derived from Simplest++ and inspired by the
Pastel Clock.

## Usage

* When the screen is unlocked, tap at the bottom of the csreen on the information text.
  It should change color showing it is selected.

* Swipe up or down to cycle through the info screens that can be displayed
  when you have finished tap again towards the centre of the screen to unselect.

* Swipe left or right to change the type of info screens displayed (by default
  there is only one type of data so this will have no effect)

* Settings are saved automatically and reloaded along with the clock.

## About Clock Info's

* The clock info modules enable all clocks to add the display of information to the clock face.

* The default clock_info module provides a display of battery %, Steps, Heart Rate and Altitude.

* Installing the [Sunrise ClockInfo](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=clkinfosunrise) adds Sunrise and Sunset times into the list of info's.
