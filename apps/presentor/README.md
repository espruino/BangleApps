# Presentor
Use your Bangle to present!
This app basically turns your BangleJS watch into a presentor tool.
Very useful for presentations or when you are teaching a lesson.

### Features:
+ Control your (powerpoint) slides by swiping left and right.
+ See pre-programmed presentation notes by swiping up and down.
+ See if you are on time in your presentation.
+ Get notified if you go over-time for a certain subject.
+ Control cursor or spotlight in mouse mode (pressing the button).
