### NiteMode

NiteMode makes your BangleJS ready for nighttime by controlling the LCD settings that might keep you awake at night in a way that's customizable to your wants/needs.

Go to Settings > App/Widget Settings > NiteMode to enable/disable NiteMode.

These settings will override your usual settings while NiteMode is on.
