## Usage

During the quiz round, each student group is provided with a response button (puck), while the teacher operates a central control device (referred to as the "bangle"). When a student presses their group’s puck, the system registers the response time and displays the order in which each group responded—first, second, and so on—on the teacher's bangle screen. This setup ensures a fair and transparent method for determining which team answered first.
