Breathing App
=============
This app attempts to aid relaxation and train breath syncronicity by providing a visualisation of a circle that expands and contracts to guide breathing rate. The app also modulates the vibration motor so you don't neccessarily have to look at the screen. Your HR is displayed in the lower left and there are a few parameters you can change to tailor what works best for you. The menu is quie self-explanatory, the 'ex_in_ratio' just allows an option to make the exhale speed slightly faster if you prefer that - durations can be further altered by increasing the pause times.

Resonance frequency breathing is a way of breathing (slow relaxed diaphragmatic breathing at around 3-7 breaths per minute) that has a regulating effect on the autonomic nervous system and other key body systems such as the circulatory system. This has many benefits, supported by numerous studies e.g.:

Increases pulmonary function  
Lowers blood pressure  
Improves baroreflex gain  
Improves heart rate variability  
Increases the ability to handle stress  
Clinical improvements in asthma
