# QTH Locator

Convert your current GPS location to the [Maidenhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System) locator system used by HAM amateur radio operators.

## Description

A Maidenhead locator compresses latitude and longitude into a short string of characters, which is similar in concept to the World Geographic Reference System or GEOREF. This position information is presented in a limited level of precision to limit the number of characters needed for its transmission using voice, Morse code, or any other operating mode.

The chosen coding uses alternating pairs of letters and digits, like so:

* BL11bh
