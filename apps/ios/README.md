# iOS integration app

This is the iOS integration app for Bangle.js. This app allows you to receive
notifications from your iPhone. The Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS)
sends all the messages to your watch.

You can allow this if you connect your Bangle to your iPhone. It will be
prompted for immediatly after you connect the Bangle to the iPhone.

### Connecting your Bangle(2).js to your iPhone

The Bangle watches are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Sometimes they
will not be seen/detected by the Bluetooth scanner in your iPhone settings
menu.

To resolve this, you can download numerous apps who can actually scan
for BLE devices. There are great ones out there, free and paid.

We really like WebBLE, which we also recommend to load apps on your
watch with your iOS device, as Safari does not support WebBluetooth
for now. It's just a few bucks/pounds/euro's.

If you like to try a free app first, you can always use NRF Toolbox or
Bluetooth BLE Device Finder to find and connect your Bangle.
