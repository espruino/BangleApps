# Hour Strike

![icon](app-icon.png)

Time passes too fast!

This app configures your `Bangle.js` so that it buzzes on the hour or on the half hour.

This app is slightly different from [Hour Chime](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/widchime). `Hour Chimee` runs as a widget but `Hour Strike` runs as a background task, without showing a widget.

## Features

- Strike the hour, the half hour, the quarter hour, and more
- Set up a range of hours that clock will strike
- Set up the strength of the strike
- Preview when the next strike will happen

## Known Issues

- This app does not know or check whether your clock already chimes on the hour.
