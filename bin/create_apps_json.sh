# apps.json used to contain the metadata for every app. Now the
# metadata is stored in each apps's directory - app/yourapp/metadata.js
#
# The app loader still wants all the data in one file, so normally
# with GitHub pages, Jekyll is automatically run and creates a working
# apps.json
#
# However if you're hosting locally, or not on GitHub pages then you
# will want to create apps.json yourself. You can do that by installing
# and running Jekyll, OR the easier option is just to run this script.
#
# If you do this, please do not attempt to commit your modified
# apps.json back into the main BangleApps repository!
#
# You can pass an optional filename to this script, and it will write
# to that instead, apps.local.json is used when opening the loader on localhost
