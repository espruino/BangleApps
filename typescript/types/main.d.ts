   * Data can be of the form `{ UUID : data_as_byte_array }`. The UUID should be a
   * [Bluetooth Service
   * ID](https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx).
   * For example to return battery level at 95%, do:
   * ```
   * NRF.setAdvertising({
   *   0x180F : [95] // Service data 0x180F = 95
   * });

   *     0x1809 : [Math.round(E.getTemperature())]
   *   });
   * }, 30000);
   * ```
   * If you specify a value for the object key, Service Data is advertised. However
   * if you specify `undefined`, the Service UUID is advertised:
   * ```
   * NRF.setAdvertising({
   *   0x180D : undefined // Advertise service UUID 0x180D (HRM)
   * });
   * ```
   * Service UUIDs can also be supplied in the second argument of `NRF.setServices`,
   * but those go in the scan response packet.
   * You can also supply the raw advertising data in an array. For example to
   * advertise as an Eddystone beacon:
   * ```
   * NRF.setAdvertising([0x03,  // Length of Service List
   *   0x03,  // Param: Service List
   *   0xAA, 0xFE,  // Eddystone ID
   *   0x13,  // Length of Service Data
   *   0x16,  // Service Data
   *   0xAA, 0xFE, // Eddystone ID
   *   0x10,  // Frame type: URL
   *   0xF8, // Power
   *   0x03, // https://
   *   'g','o','o','.','g','l','/','B','3','J','0','O','c'],
   *     {interval:100});
   * ```
   * (However for Eddystone we'd advise that you use the [Espruino Eddystone
   * library](/Puck.js+Eddystone))
   * **Note:** When specifying data as an array, certain advertising options such as
   * `discoverable` and `showName` won't have any effect.
   * **Note:** The size of Bluetooth LE advertising packets is limited to 31 bytes.
   * If you want to advertise more data, consider using an array for `data` (See
   * below), or `NRF.setScanResponse`.
   * You can even specify an array of arrays or objects, in which case each
   * advertising packet will be used in turn - for instance to make your device
   * advertise battery level and its name as well as both Eddystone and iBeacon :
   * ```
   * NRF.setAdvertising([
   *   {0x180F : [Puck.getBatteryPercentage()]}, // normal advertising, with battery %
   *   require("ble_ibeacon").get(...), // iBeacon
   *   require("ble_eddystone").get(...), // eddystone
   * ], {interval:300});
   * ```
   * `options` is an object, which can contain:
   * ```
   * {
   *   name: "Hello" // The name of the device
   *   showName: true/false // include full name, or nothing
   *   discoverable: true/false // general discoverable, or limited - default is limited
   *   connectable: true/false // whether device is connectable - default is true
   *   scannable : true/false // whether device can be scanned for scan response packets - default is true
   *   interval: 600 // Advertising interval in msec, between 20 and 10000 (default is 375ms)
   *   manufacturer: 0x0590 // IF sending manufacturer data, this is the manufacturer ID
   *   manufacturerData: [...] // IF sending manufacturer data, this is an array of data
   *   phy: "1mbps/2mbps/coded" // (NRF52840 only) use the long-range coded phy for transmission (1mbps default)
   * }
   * ```
   * Setting `connectable` and `scannable` to false gives the lowest power
   * consumption as the BLE radio doesn't have to listen after sending advertising.
   * **NOTE:** Non-`connectable` advertising can't have an advertising interval less
   * than 100ms according to the BLE spec.
   * So for instance to set the name of Puck.js without advertising any other data
   * you can just use the command:
   * ```
   * NRF.setAdvertising({},{name:"Hello"});
   * ```
   * You can also specify 'manufacturer data', which is another form of advertising
   * data. We've registered the Manufacturer ID 0x0590 (as Pur3 Ltd) for use with
   * *Official Espruino devices* - use it to advertise whatever data you'd like, but
   * we'd recommend using JSON.
   * For example by not advertising a device name you can send up to 24 bytes of JSON
   * on Espruino's manufacturer ID:
   * ```
   * var data = {a:1,b:2};
   * NRF.setAdvertising({},{
   *   showName:false,
   *   manufacturer:0x0590,
   *   manufacturerData:JSON.stringify(data)
   * });
   * ```
   * If you're using [EspruinoHub](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoHub) then it
   * will automatically decode this into the folling MQTT topics:
   * * `/ble/advertise/ma:c_:_a:dd:re:ss/espruino` -> `{"a":10,"b":15}`
   * * `/ble/advertise/ma:c_:_a:dd:re:ss/a` -> `1`
   * * `/ble/advertise/ma:c_:_a:dd:re:ss/b` -> `2`
   * Note that **you only have 24 characters available for JSON**, so try to use the
   * shortest field names possible and avoid floating point values that can be very
   * long when converted to a String.
   *
   * @param {any} data - The service data to advertise as an object - see below for more info

   * **Note:** UUIDs can be integers between `0` and `0xFFFF`, strings of the form

   *   ams : true // optional, Bangle.js-only, enable Apple AMS support for media control
   * });
   * ```
   * To enable BLE HID, you must set `hid` to an array which is the BLE report
   * descriptor. The easiest way to do this is to use the `ble_hid_controls` or
   * `ble_hid_keyboard` modules.
   * **Note:** Just creating a service doesn't mean that the service will be
   * advertised. It will only be available after a device connects. To advertise,
   * specify the UUIDs you wish to advertise in the `advertise` field of the second
   * `options` argument. For example this will create and advertise a heart rate
   * service:
   * ```
   * NRF.setServices({
   *   0x180D: { // heart_rate
   *     0x2A37: { // heart_rate_measurement
   *       notify: true,
   *       value : [0x06, heartrate],
   *     }
   *   }
   * }, { advertise: [ '180D' ] });
   * ```
   * You may specify 128 bit UUIDs to advertise, however you may get a `DATA_SIZE`
   * exception because there is insufficient space in the Bluetooth LE advertising
   * packet for the 128 bit UART UUID as well as the UUID you specified. In this case
   * you can add `uart:false` after the `advertise` element to disable the UART,
   * however you then be unable to connect to Puck.js's console via Bluetooth.
   * If you absolutely require two or more 128 bit UUIDs then you will have to
   * specify your own raw advertising data packets with `NRF.setAdvertising`
   * **Note:** The services on Espruino can only be modified when there is no device
   * connected to it as it requires a restart of the Bluetooth stack. **iOS devices
   * will 'cache' the list of services** so apps like NRF Connect may incorrectly
   * display the old services even after you have modified them. To fix this, disable
   * and re-enable Bluetooth on your iOS device, or use an Android device to run NRF
   * Connect.
   * **Note:** Not all combinations of security configuration values are valid, the

   * You can also use 128 bit UUIDs, for example
   * `"b7920001-3c1b-4b40-869f-3c0db9be80c6"`.
   * To define a service and characteristic and then notify connected clients of a
   * change to it when a button is pressed:
   * ```
   * NRF.setServices({
   *   0xBCDE : {
   *     0xABCD : {
   *       value : "Hello",
   *       maxLen : 20,
   *       notify: true
   *     }
   *   }
   * });
   * setWatch(function() {
   *   NRF.updateServices({

   *       }
   *     }
   *   });
   * }, BTN, { repeat:true, edge:"rising", debounce: 50 });
   * ```
   * This only works if the characteristic was created with `notify: true` using
   * `NRF.setServices`, otherwise the characteristic will be updated but no
   * notification will be sent.
   * Also note that `maxLen` was specified. If it wasn't then the maximum length of
   * the characteristic would have been 5 - the length of `"Hello"`.
   * To indicate (i.e. notify with ACK) connected clients of a change to the '0xABCD'
   * characteristic in the '0xBCDE' service:
   * ```
   * NRF.updateServices({
   *   0xBCDE : {
   *     0xABCD : {
   *       value : "World",
   *       indicate: true

   *   "name": "DeviceName"       // the advertised device name
   *  }
   * ```
   * You can also supply a set of filters (as described in `NRF.requestDevice`) as a
   * second argument, which will allow you to filter the devices you get a callback
   * for. This helps to cut down on the time spent processing JavaScript code in

   * with the manufacturer data `0x0590` (Espruino's ID) you could do:

   * ```
   * You can also specify `active:true` in the second argument to perform active
   * scanning (this requests scan response packets) from any devices it finds.
   * **Note:** Using a filter in `setScan` filters each advertising packet
   * individually. As a result, if you filter based on a service UUID and a device
   * advertises with multiple packets (or a scan response when `active:true`) only
   * the packets matching the filter are returned. To aggregate multiple packets you
   * can use `NRF.findDevices`.
   * **Note:** BLE advertising packets can arrive quickly - faster than you'll be
   * able to print them to the console. It's best only to print a few, or to use a
   * function like `NRF.findDevices(..)` which will collate a list of available
   * devices.
   * **Note:** Using setScan turns the radio's receive mode on constantly. This can

   * You can find out which pins to use by looking at [your board's reference
   * page](#boards) and searching for pins with the `UART`/`USART` markers.
   * If not specified in options, the default pins are used for rx and tx (usually
   * the lowest numbered pins on the lowest port that supports this peripheral). `ck`
   * and `cts` are not used unless specified.
   * Note that even after changing the RX and TX pins, if you have called setup
   * before then the previous RX and TX pins will still be connected to the Serial
   * port as well - until you set them to something else using `digitalWrite` or
   * `pinMode`.
   * Flow control can be xOn/xOff (`flow:'xon'`) or hardware flow control (receive
   * only) if `cts` is specified. If `cts` is set to a pin, the pin's value will be 0
   * when Espruino is ready for data and 1 when it isn't.
   * By default, framing or parity errors don't create `framing` or `parity` events
   * on the `Serial` object because storing these errors uses up additional storage
   * in the queue. If you're intending to receive a lot of malformed data then the
   * queue might overflow `E.getErrorFlags()` would return `FIFO_FULL`. However if
   * you need to respond to `framing` or `parity` errors then you'll need to use
   * `errors:true` when initialising serial.
   * On Linux builds there is no default Serial device, so you must specify a path to
   * a device - for instance: `Serial1.setup(9600,{path:"/dev/ttyACM0"})`
   * You can also set up 'software serial' using code like:
   * ```
   * var s = new Serial();
   * s.setup(9600,{rx:a_pin, tx:a_pin});

   *   * (Bangle.js 2) `scroll : int` - an integer specifying how much the initial
   *     menu should be scrolled by

   *     `scroller.scroll` returns the amount the menu is currently scrolled by
   * * In the object specified for editable numbers:
   *   * (Bangle.js 2) the `format` function is called with `format(value)` in the
   *     main menu, `format(value,1)` when in a scrollable list, or `format(value,2)`
   *     when in a popup window.
   * You can also specify menu items as an array (rather than an Object). This can be
   * useful if you have menu items with the same title, or you want to `push` menu
   * items onto an array:
   * ```
   * var menu = [

  /**
   * Sets the RTC's prescaler's maximum value. This is the counter that counts up on

   * value supplied, one second is deemed to have passed.
   * By default this is set to the oscillator's average speed as specified in the
   * datasheet, and usually that is fine. However on early [Espruino Pico](/Pico)
   * boards the STM32F4's internal oscillator could vary by as much as 15% from the
   * value in the datasheet. In that case you may want to alter this value to reflect
   * the true RTC speed for more accurate timekeeping.
   * To change the RTC's prescaler value to a computed value based on comparing
   * against the high speed oscillator, just run the following command, making sure
   * it's done a few seconds after the board starts up:
   * ```
   * E.setRTCPrescaler(E.getRTCPrescaler(true));
   * ```
   * When changing the RTC prescaler, the RTC 'follower' counters are reset and it
   * can take a second or two before readings from getTime are stable again.
   * To test, you can connect an input pin to a known frequency square wave and then
   * use `setWatch`. If you don't have a frequency source handy, you can check
   * against the high speed oscillator:
   * ```
   * // connect pin B3 to B4
   * analogWrite(B3, 0.5, {freq:0.5});
   * setWatch(function(e) {
   *   print(e.time - e.lastTime);
   * }, B4, {repeat:true});
   * ```
   * **Note:** This is only used on official Espruino boards containing an STM32
   * microcontroller. Other boards (even those using an STM32) don't use the RTC and
   * so this has no effect.
   *
   * @param {number} prescaler - The amount of counts for one second of the RTC - this is a 15 bit integer value (0..32767)

 *  * `data` is included if `data:pin` was specified in the options, and can be
 *    used for reading in clocked data
 * For instance, if you want to measure the length of a positive pulse you could
 * use `setWatch(function(e) { console.log(e.time-e.lastTime); }, BTN, {
 * repeat:true, edge:'falling' });`. This will only be called on the falling edge
 * of the pulse, but will be able to measure the width of the pulse because
 * `e.lastTime` is the time of the rising edge.
 * Internally, an interrupt writes the time of the pin's state change into a queue
 * with the exact time that it happened, and the function supplied to `setWatch` is
 * executed only from the main message loop. However, if the callback is a native
 * function `void (bool state)` then you can add `irq:true` to options, which will
 * cause the function to be called from within the IRQ. When doing this, interrupts
 * will happen on both edges and there will be no debouncing.
 * **Note:** if you didn't call `pinMode` beforehand then this function will reset
 * pin's state to `"input"`
 * **Note:** The STM32 chip (used in the [Espruino Board](/EspruinoBoard) and
 * [Pico](/Pico)) cannot watch two pins with the same number - eg `A0` and `B0`.
 * **Note:** On nRF52 chips (used in Puck.js, Pixl.js, MDBT42Q) `setWatch` disables
 * the GPIO output on that pin. In order to be able to write to the pin again you
 * need to disable the watch with `clearWatch`.
 *
 * @param {any} function - A Function or String to be executed
 * @param {Pin} pin - The pin to watch
 * @param {any} options - If a boolean or integer, it determines whether to call this once (false = default) or every time a change occurs (true). Can be an object of the form `{ repeat: true/false(default), edge:'rising'/'falling'/'both'(default), debounce:10}` - see below for more information.

     * pullup resistor to 5v on STM32 based boards (nRF52 are not 5v tolerant so you
     * can't do this), or can use a level shifter to shift the voltage up into the 5v
