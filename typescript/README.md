# Bangle.ts

A generic project setup for compiling apps from Typescript to
Bangle.js-ready, readable JavaScript.

The types are now automatically generated by a script (see
[here](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/TYPESCRIPT.md).

## Compilation

Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and node.js if you haven't already. We recommend using a version manager like nvm, which is also referenced in the linked documentation.
Make sure you are using node version 16 by running `nvm use 16` and npm version ^8 by running `npm -v`. If the latter version is incorrect, run `npm i -g npm@^8`.

After having installed npm for your platform, open a terminal, and navigate into the `/typescript` folder. Then run:

```
npm ci
```

to install the project's build tools, and:

```
npm run build
```

To build all Typescript apps and widgets. The last command will generate the `app.js` files containing the transpiled code for the Bangle.js.
