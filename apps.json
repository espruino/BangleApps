# =================================================================
#    ALL THE INFORMATION INSIDE APPS.JSON HAS NOW BEEN MOVED
# 
#  You'll find it inside a file called apps/yourapp/metadata.json
# 
#  Otherwise nothing has changed. GitHub Pages will automatically
#  create apps.json as your site is hosted, or if you're hosting
#  yourself you can run bin/create_apps_json.sh
#
#  If you serve the store from localhost for development/testing,
#  the loader looks for apps.local.json instead, you can run
#  `bin/create_apps_json.sh apps.local.json` to create that file.
# =================================================================

# Uncomment the following line if you only want explicitly listed
# apps to be available on your site

# restricted: ["boot", "launch", "antonclk", "health", "setting", "about", "widbat", "widbt", "widlock", "widid"]
